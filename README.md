# Node sitemap generator

A sitemap generator

---

My first node.js attempt, this will check the directory that it is placed in and then take all the .html or .php files that are found there and generate a sitemap. index will be replaced with / and will also place the current date in the sitemap.

## Installation

node.js must be installed in the same directory as sitemap.js then go to the command line and npm sitemap

## Licence
